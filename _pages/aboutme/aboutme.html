    <p>My name is <strong>Rais Fazriansyah</strong>, and I am a dedicated writer from <strong>Majalengka, West Java, Indonesia</strong>. With a passion for storytelling, I believe that writing opens windows to the depths of the soul, revealing layers of truth and emotion that often go unnoticed in our daily lives.</p>
