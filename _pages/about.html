    <h2>About {{ site.name }}</h2>
    <p>Hi there! Welcome to <strong>{{ site.name }}</strong>, my little corner of the internet where I share my love for all things beauty. This blog is a space where I can express my passion for makeup, skincare, and self-care, and hopefully help you along your beauty journey too!</p>

    <h3>Why I Started {{ site.name }}</h3>
    <p>I've always believed that beauty isn’t just about looking good, but also about feeling good in your own skin. After trying so many beauty products, watching endless tutorials, and learning through my own experiences, I decided to create <strong>{{ site.name }}</strong> to share what I've learned with others. Whether it’s a new makeup trick, skincare routine, or beauty hack, I want this blog to be a place where you can find easy, practical tips to enhance your natural beauty.</p>

    <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>

        <li><strong>Skincare Tips:</strong> Taking care of your skin is so important! I’ll share skincare routines that are easy to follow and tips for finding products that suit your skin type.</li>
        <li><strong>Beauty Product Reviews:</strong> I’m always trying out new beauty products, and I love sharing my honest thoughts on what works (and what doesn’t) so you can make better choices when shopping for your own beauty needs.</li>
    </ul>
