    <li><strong>Apply Your Hair Products:</strong> Whether it's a scalp serum, oil, or treatment mask, apply your product first before using the massager to help it absorb into your scalp more effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Massage for 5-10 Minutes:</strong> Gently move the massager in circular motions across your scalp, focusing on areas where you want to stimulate hair growth or relieve tension.</li>
